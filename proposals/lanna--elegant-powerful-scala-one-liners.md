Statically typed languages, in general, have a bad reputation of being
particularly verbose. Scala is the static language that feels dynamic.
With its powerful, flexible, and expressive syntax, concise yet not terse,
a single line of Scala code can leverage an impressive amount of JVM power.
It's not about short code, it's about clear code.

In this fun, engaging, and interactive live code presentation (done entirely
in the Scala REPL!) I show you some of the most powerful and elegant Scala
one-liners that give us dynamic productivity in a static language.

Secret features of case classes, hidden gems in the collections library, tricks
with extension methods, magic variable declaration, slick Java integration,
easier than ever regexes, reading news from the Web, plotting charts in the
terminal, running system process, and even computer-generated Unicode art.
Is it all possible in a single line of Scala or less?

Bring your REPL, we are going to have a great time writing some code!
